### Introduction - Tiramisu and Why Recipe Writers can't stop ranting. 

This incredibly simple Tiramisu recipe takes only less than 30 minutes to prepare (and a few hours to chill). Even though it is not as authentic, this recipe still surely satisfies your sweet tooth and crave for this famous Italian treat. With only 6 ingredients and no baking required, this is a fool-proof dessert that guarantees success everytime. So even with no prior experience, do not hesistate to treat yourself or your loved ones with some sugar and cocoa!

One thing I hate about online recipe is the lengthy, beat-around-the-bush writing style. The writers would go on and on about a story that barely relates to the recipe. Turns out, they have to! Apparently, most cooking recipes are pretty similar, and one method is usually insprired by others, with some personal touches of the writers. So, in order to avoid potential plagiarism, recipe writers usually add many other details, so the cooking is just a part of the whole article. 

Unfortunately, this is also the protocol that I have to follow, at least if I want to keep this blog up and running for a while :). But I figure, instead of going rouge about how this cake changes my life or other nonsense, I can share some fun fact about food science I learn here and there, for example cacao is the bean, cacao powder is made from unroasted, fermented cacao beans at low temperatetures, and cocoa powder is processed at much higher temperateture and often contains added sugar and dairy powder. For that reason, cacao powder is vegan while most cocoa powder is not. Pretty interesting, right? At least for me. If you enjoy these little fun facts, I will blend them into my recipe blogs. But if that is not your cup of tea, worry not, and jump right into the Recipe section using the shortcut in Table of Content. 

### Recipe

#### Ingredients:

As mentioned above, this recipe requires only 6 ingredients, all of which can be easily found at any market. Unfortunately, I haven't had any chances to manoeuvre a vegan/vegeterian version of this. But hopefully in the future, I can find substitutes for them.

For 6-8 servings:

- 500 grams mascarpone, room temperature

- 200 grams heavy whipping cream (30+%)

- 4 Tablespoons instant coffee

- 150 grams granulated sugar

- 200 grams Lady Fingers
