Hello visitor, thank you for checking out my blog. My name is Long, which translates to Dragon in Vietnamese. Ironically enough, I'm only 165cm tall. And despite my dragon-inspried name, I promise I don't look as intimitating or scary as you might expect. 

I am working towards my Master's degree in Macadamia (abbreviation for Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence) at Aalto University, where I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Data Science in 2022. I'm also a Data Analyst at Nordea - one of the biggest banks in Europe, where I put my technical skills and analytical thinking into actions, supporting internal stakeholders in fact-based decision-making and strategy planning. I occasionally participate in competitions such as Junction - the biggest hackathon in Europe, or Deep Dive - an emerging case study competition in Finland. These are advantageous ventures to sharpen my technical toolbox, challenge my problem solving skills, and connect with ambitious, like-minded people. 

During my free time, I love recreating traditional cuisine to assuage my homesickness. I also enjoy experimenting with food, learning about "food science", and creating fusion recipes of the East and West. At the start of 2024, I started my journey in exploring vegan and meat-free cuisine, hoping to improve my health, sooth my soul, and clear the stigma about veganism. Some of my other hobbies include painting, floristry, badminton, and dancing. I am a beginner in pole dancing, and I will participate in an introduction Salsa class. Recently, I find an interest in visual art, specifically in famous paintors such as Monet or Von Wright. I plan to learn more about their works, and in that process discover more otherworldly pieces of other artists.
