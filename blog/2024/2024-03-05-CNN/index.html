Struggling to comprehend, distinguish, and reminisce these concepts myself sometimes, especially before and during important interviews, I would treasure a lot a source of simple, concise, accurate information to revise for those occasions. With that in mind, I created this blog series including fundamental AI/ML concepts and relating interview questions for those preparing to launch their career in the field, or for those who simply need a refresh before moving on to more complicated concepts. If you fancy to dig deeper into these topics, you can refer to my <a href="https://ottovintola.github.io/blog/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">colleague’s blog</a> for a more comprehensive and thorough series.</p> <p>In this first blog, we will go through the concept of Deep Learning, Linear Classifier, Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) and Backpropagation</p> <h2 id="cnn---what-is-it">CNN - what is it?</h2> <p>to be filled</p> <hr> <h2 id="convolutional-layer">Convolutional Layer</h2> <p>to be filled</p> <hr> <h2 id="convolutional-network">Convolutional Network</h2> <p>something</p> <h3 id="components">Components</h3> <p>filter/kernel (the small matrix) is applied to input -&gt; feature map 1 layers have many filters -&gt; many feature maps -&gt; organized along channel dim (depth of the layer) 1 feature map corresponds to 1 channel to represent response of the filter to different areas of the input, capturing different aspects of the data.
